### Welcome to my website!

I'm Martin Chang, a Mechanical Engineer with a passion for computer vision, robotics, and additive manufacturing with several years of experience - industry and hobby included. In my downtime when I'm not tinkering with a 3D Printer or some other hardware, I enjoy reading, writing, soccer, swimming, tennis and playing the piano. I'll never say no to some good old reality TV though!

I was born in Pyeongtaek, South Korea in 2001 and moved to Canada when I was a child. I've moved several times within my childhood within the GTA and London, Ontario - I'm no stranger to meeting new people and having to make friends, haha.

Some of my other hobbies include playing chess, trivia and following esports (LoL, CS, Smash). I mostly watch LCS/LEC in LoL with Showmaker being my favourite player, a Faze fan in CS (go Karrigan!), and no particular favourite in Smash.

I'm also a fan of all major Toronto sports - Jays, Raptors, Leafs, TFC. I also follow the Spurs across the pond in England. COYS! I will say, the years have not been kind to me as a fan...

I enjoy lots of variety of music - 70/80/90's Rock, Alternative, KPop, JPop, and OST/Scores of Movies/TV Shows/Other Media are what I listen to regularly.

Video Games are also always a guilty pleasure of mine. Mostly play singleplayer JRPGs and Western RPGs these days, though I'll boot up LoL or CS2 with friends once in a while.

I play Smash semi-competitively on and off over the years. Mained Marth in Brawl, Lucina and Cloud in Smash 4, and currently play Diddy Kong, Wii Fit Trainer and Greninja in Ultimate.

I love reviewing stuff! Video Games, Movies, KDramas, Manga/Anime, etc. You can see them throughout my site.
