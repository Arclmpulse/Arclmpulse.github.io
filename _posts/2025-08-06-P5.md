Persona 5 is a legendary game, many have it as one of the best JRPGs ever. I agree... with some caveats.

This will be a hot take from me: plot was decent, but I don't think it stays consistently good enough for me to say it's good overall. The main theme of the game with corruption, vices and standing up to injustice was good at first, and we do see this in the first few palaces. But they really ham it in to you that "we live in a society" where it becomes grating a bit. It's really such a shame, the first palace with Kamoshida is one of the best story arcs I've ever played in a video game and then... it just slowly falls off. I think Futaba's palace/Pyramid brought it back a bit, and then it's followed up by the worst palace in the game with Haru. The story picks up again with the casino and the deceit there to trick Goro was extremely brilliant, but the cruise ship was disappointing before the plot recovered yet again with the final arc.

Characters... oh man. Another hot take, I did not like the Phantom Thieves overall. The trio of Joker, Ann and Ryuji was hilarious and incredible (dumb, dumber, dumbest, but in which order?), I also thought Yusuke was great with the way he interacted with that trio but everyone after felt like they never really interacted with each other. Makoto/Futaba/Haru/Goro did not feel like a cohesive group and the tone shift of the gang felt very corporate once they began to join - like employees reporting to Boss Joker. It was clearly a group that was there only for Joker and the overall goal of the group, and it showed at the end when they split ways without keeping in touch. Which is realistic and I don't think it's a bad thing, but it really does feel weird that these guys who lived through so much together were barely friendly with each other. As individual characters though, I would say most of them were written pretty well, barring Haru for reasons outside of her control. Yusuke and Makoto's arcs were done fairly well but were a bit shallow following their own palaces and Futaba was a standout character with her backstory/mother.

Well, except a certain cat. I really hated Morgana, loathing does not properly explain how much disdain I had for him. Extremely entitled, when he felt like Makoto and Futaba were replacing him in the party with their combined brainpower he throws a tantrum and defects, very hypocritical with his bullying, simping over Ann got tiring pretty quickly, etc etc. He didn't even really get a redemption arc when he comes back, there were no changes in his character. I fully believe the party could left his stinkin' ass, cannot believe they wasted Chopper/Pikachu's VA on him ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

Shido was a terrible disappointment as the _main villain_ as well. It just felt like he folded so easily after being hyped up by the game for 75% of it, which I guess makes sense with the events that happen immediately after, but you'd think they wouldn't have just tossed him away so easily like that.

Yaldabaoth on the other hand... was incredible. I never saw his twist of being fake Igor pulling the strings behind all the major palaces and events in the game coming. Him being born of society's collective will to avoid responsibility and ultimately enable corruption by being apathetic to it was a great twist. Him giving Joker his powers and seeing what he would do with "freedom" brought the plot full circle as Joker ultimately stays the course and forces the world to think for themselves again by defeating Yaldy. And what was really mind blowing was that Igor's previous VA from past games passed away between P4 and P5, so when you hear him for the first time and hear that distorted voice, you'd probably just assume it was a difference in creative direction to change his voice. Not it being an actual plot point and real Igor coming in with a similar voice to the old Igor, it was super well done.

Gameplay is where this game shines. By far the best JRPG gameplay I've personally played, running around in Tokyo was incredible. The dungeon crawling was fantastic with the puzzles, they even added some platforming too. Recruiting personas using dialogue was cool though it got kinda annoying after a bit. Lots of quality of life changes to the Velvet Room and fusing Personas, all of which was great. Combat is... well, easy. They introduced side arms, showtimes and baton passes which makes for more interesting combos and sequences in fights, but... they just make the game so easy, I think it was ultimately a mistake to. Adding Nuke and Psy elements was fine, I could've lived without it but it was nice having more weaknesses to exploit.

The DLC that revolved around Maruki, Kasumi and Goro after the ending of P5 was good overall, and really tied back into Yaldy's point that creating a world where people can be sheep may indeed make people happier as Maruki picks up the baton and comes very close to creating that world. I liked all three of them, and thought their arcs were done well. Goro in particular was a great character - he was good enough as a secondary antagonist in the original game as the backstabber/traitor of the gang, but Royal gives us a what-if scenario after he passes away in the main game and comes back as a memory as a fully playable character, and him rejecting Maruki's world and trying to stop him out of his own free will was beautifully done.

I do like to think that the song "Our Light" is about Goro, his relationship with Joker throughout the game and how he represented Joker if he chose to become a villain instead of an anti-hero, or rather how Goro could've been chosen as "Joker" by Yaldy instead and I don't think the plot would've changed very much was always very fascinating to me. Also you know, Goro had to be born out of someone's desire for him to be alive. Joker, you aren't fooling anyone.

Persona 5 has one of the most famous OSTs in the video game world! Every track slapped. Some of my personal favourites include, Last Surprise, Beneath the Mask, Our Light, Colours Flying High, and Life Will Change. I do be playing Beneath the Mask when I'm driving home late at night from the train station, always a vibe.

A game that started off as fighting corruption and being vigilantes to ultimately asking the question of whether it is better or worse for people to have free will, this game did a lot right. But they failed to nail the one thing that makes Persona games unique. An overall strong main cast whose stories you get invested in. And for that reason, I can't put this game up there as high as some people, in spite of the gameplay and more or less interesting plot. I do think it is the best overall game of the series, just not... the best "Persona" game, if that makes any sense.
