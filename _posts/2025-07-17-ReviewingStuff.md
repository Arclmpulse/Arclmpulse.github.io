## Background

If you found yourself here, well, I guess you have nothing better to do, heh. Why don't you turn back and do something more productive with your time, like learning about the history of the universe?

In all seriousness, if you're here, it's because you accidentally clicked on this, or you wanted to get more insight on how I review things. While I can't give you a satisfying answer on the former, I can give you an answer on the latter. Read on!

## Navigating

To quickly access my review content on media, you can head to the **categories** tab on the left. Once you're in there, you'll see a bunch of folders that look like this:

If you're interested in seeing a master list of my games, Kdramas, movies, shows, etc. and how I approximately rank them relative to each other, you can scroll down towards all of the different master lists.

To quickly access a particular franchise or publisher, you'll need to go into the **tags** tab on the left. Once in there, you'll see a list of titles. Simply click on the one you're interested in, and it'll blow up into a list of all of the associated titles with that tag.

Alternatively, you can also just enter a search query on the top right of the site.

## Methodology

**To get it out of the way early, all of my reviews have spoilers! I'll always open the review with the score to try and prevent passers-by from getting spoiled, but I will be talking about what happens during the media freely!**

I've debated whether using a percentage scale, x/10 scale, x/5 scale, etc. I ended up settling on x/10 with .5 increments. Gives enough different tiers to differentiate between titles while still having a clear hierarchy between the groups.

I also decided on using the academic/high school way of marking. AKA, 5/10 is the borderline of pass/fail, anything below that is varying levels of putrid, 10/10 is perfect, majority of the titles I review will fit under 6-9/10. Nice. My rationale is that I think very few titles genuinely have nothing redeeming it. Of course there are some exceptions, but generally I think it's fair for 50% to be the benchmark of whether you should try watching/playing it or not.

Loosely, I will generally try to comment on the major characters, overall plot, villains, and my takeaways from what I thought the writer of the media was trying to convey. Of course in the case of games I'll need to factor in combat/general gameplay, map design, other tidbits as well.

I am a bit of a hopeless romantic, I won't deny I'll probably be biased a bit if there's a well-executed romance in a title. Nothing I appreciate more than a cheesy, trashy rom-com!

Lastly in the case of games, my structure to review games with a compilation of levels in them like Ace Attorney or Hitman World of Assassination will have me reviewing each individual level instead. I'll be averaging out the scores to give the game it's overall rating.

Thank you for your attention to this matter! ðŸ˜‰
